# Create New GitHub Repository: meetrix-mobile-ui

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub (Do This First!)

**You need to create the repository on GitHub first before pushing.**

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `meetrix-mobile-ui`
3. **Description** (optional): "Meetrix Mobile App - React Native"
4. **Visibility**: 
   - ✅ Public (recommended, free)
   - ⬜ Private (if you want it private)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (you already have these)
6. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Push to New Repository

Once you've created the repository on GitHub, I've already updated your git remote. Just run:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

Or if the repository was just created and you get an error, try:

```bash
git push -u origin main --force
```

## What I've Already Done

✅ **Updated git remote** to: `https://github.com/sbhoopat/meetrix-mobile-ui.git`
✅ **Staged all changes** for commit
✅ **Ready to push** once repository is created

## After Creating Repository

Once you've created `meetrix-mobile-ui` on GitHub, the push command will work automatically.

If you need to verify the remote:
```bash
git remote -v
```

Should show:
```
origin  https://github.com/sbhoopat/meetrix-mobile-ui.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/sbhoopat/meetrix-mobile-ui.git (push)
```

---

## Quick Steps Summary

1. **Create repo on GitHub**: https://github.com/new
   - Name: `meetrix-mobile-ui`
   - Don't initialize with anything
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Push from command line**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

**That's it!** 🚀
